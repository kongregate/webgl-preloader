## DESCRIPTION

This is a template for WebGL-based Unity games. It includes a simple preloader, the script required to connect to the Kongregate API through Unity, and removes any extra buffer space around the game window.

**This preloader is for Unity 5.6 and above.** For older versions, [click here](https://github.com/kongregate/webgl-preloader/tree/unity-5.5-and-below).

## INSTRUCTIONS

Place the "Kong Preloader" folder into a "WebGLTemplates" folder in your assets. In the WebGL player settings window, there should now be an option to use it as the template when building your game. The folder where you export your project has to be called "build" for the game to load properly. That's it! All done.
